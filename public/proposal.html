<h1>MACOC New Website &mdash; Proposal</h1>
<p><strong>Musical Arts Competition of Orange County</strong><br>
Current website: https://www.musicalartsoc.org</p>

<div class="dev-link">
  <strong>Preview (In Development):</strong> A working preview of the new website is available at
  <a href="https://macoc.vercel.app">https://macoc.vercel.app</a><br>
  This is a development version for review purposes only. Content, design, and features are still being finalized.
</div>

<hr>

<h2>What Is This Document?</h2>

<p>We are proposing a new website system for MACOC. Before we finalize anything, we would like to share the plan and get your feedback.</p>

<p>The current website uses <a href="https://www.wix.com">Wix</a> for the website and <a href="https://www.jotform.com">Jotform</a> for registration forms. These services have served us well, but we believe there is an opportunity to <strong>simplify management</strong> and <strong>reduce costs</strong> by moving to a new setup.</p>

<p>This document outlines the proposed plan in three areas:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Website Content</strong> &mdash; How content would be managed going forward</li>
  <li><strong>Registration Form</strong> &mdash; How the registration and data tracking would work</li>
  <li><strong>Billing</strong> &mdash; How payments would be processed</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Nothing is final yet.</strong> We welcome your questions, suggestions, and feedback so we can build the best solution for everyone.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Website Content Management</h2>

<h3>What could you change?</h3>

<table>
  <tr><th>Item</th><th>Example</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Competition date</td><td>Saturday, May 16, 2026</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Competition location</td><td>California State University, Long Beach</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Registration period</td><td>Open date, close date, late deadline</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Winners Concert</td><td>Date, location, time</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Fees</td><td>Membership $40, Entry $50, Late Fee $70</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Contact info</td><td>Email addresses, division chairs</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Past winners</td><td>Winners list by year</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Teacher directory</td><td>Teacher list by instrument</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>How would you change it?</h3>

<p><strong>Through Google Sheets (similar to Excel)</strong></p>

<p>All website content would be organized in a Google Sheets spreadsheet.<br>
When you edit the spreadsheet, the website would update automatically.</p>

<div class="step-box">
  <p><strong>Proposed update process:</strong></p>
  <p>1. Open the Google Sheets spreadsheet</p>
  <p>2. Find the cell you want to change</p>
  <p>3. Type the new information</p>
  <p>4. It saves automatically</p>
  <p>5. The website updates automatically</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Example: Changing the competition date</strong></p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Key</th><th>Value</th></tr>
  <tr><td>competition.date</td><td>Saturday, May 16, 2026</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You would simply change "Saturday, May 16, 2026" to the new date. That's it.</p>

<p><strong>Example: Adding this year's winners</strong></p>
<p>Go to the Winners tab, add a new row, and enter the year, division, place, and name.</p>

<div class="key-point">
  <strong>Key Point:</strong> Instead of using a separate website editor, you would manage everything through a Google Sheets spreadsheet &mdash; which works just like Excel.
</div>

<hr>

<h2>2. Registration Form Management</h2>

<h3>How would the registration process work?</h3>

<p>The proposed registration form would guide students through 3 simple steps:</p>

<div class="step-box">
  <p><strong>Step 1: Student &amp; Teacher Information</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Teacher: Name, email, phone number</li>
    <li>Student: Name, email, date of birth, age, address</li>
    <li>Proof of age upload (birth certificate or passport)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Step 2: Repertoire Information</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Select division (e.g., Piano)</li>
    <li>Select section (based on age)</li>
    <li>Two pieces: Title, composer, time period</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Step 3: Review, Submit &amp; Pay</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Review all entered information</li>
    <li>Click the Submit button</li>
    <li>Complete payment on the Stripe payment page</li>
    <li>Automatic confirmation email sent to student/parent after successful registration and payment</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>Where would you view registrations?</h3>

<p><strong>Directly in Google Sheets.</strong></p>

<p>Every time someone registers, a new row would be automatically added to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. For example:</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Time</th><th>Payment</th><th>Teacher</th><th>Student</th><th>Division</th><th>Section</th><th>Repertoire</th></tr>
  <tr><td>2026-03-20</td><td>Pending</td><td>Kim, Jane</td><td>Park, David</td><td>Piano</td><td>Section III</td><td>Sonata...</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2026-03-21</td><td>Pending</td><td>Lee, Sarah</td><td>Choi, Emily</td><td>Piano</td><td>Section V</td><td>Prelude...</td></tr>
</table>

<p>At a glance, you would be able to see:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Who registered</strong> (student name, teacher name)</li>
  <li><strong>When they registered</strong> (date and time)</li>
  <li><strong>Whether they paid</strong> (Payment Status: Pending = not yet, Paid = done)</li>
  <li><strong>Which division</strong> (Piano, Strings, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>What pieces they will perform</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Proof of age document</strong> (click the link to view it instantly)</li>
</ul>

<div class="key-point">
  <strong>Key Point:</strong> Instead of logging into a separate service, all registration data would be available in Google Sheets &mdash; a tool many of us already use.
</div>

<h3>Where would proof-of-age documents be stored?</h3>

<p>Documents uploaded by students (birth certificates, passports) would be stored securely in <strong>Cloudinary</strong>, a safe file storage service.<br>
You would click the link in Google Sheets to view any document instantly.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Billing Management</h2>

<h3>How would the payment process work?</h3>

<div class="step-box">
  <p>1. Student fills out the registration form and submits it</p>
  <p>2. A "Complete Payment" button appears</p>
  <p>3. Clicking the button takes them to a <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> payment page</p>
  <p>4. Student (or parent) enters their card information and pays</p>
  <p>5. Payment is recorded in Google Sheets</p>
  <p>6. Confirmation email is sent to the student/parent</p>
</div>

<h3>What is Stripe?</h3>

<p><a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> is one of the most widely used online payment services in the world.<br>
Major companies like Amazon and Google use it. It is safe and reliable.</p>

<h3>Where would you check payment status?</h3>

<p>You would be able to check in two places:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Google Sheets</strong> &mdash; Check the "Payment Status" column in the registrations list</li>
  <li><strong>Stripe Dashboard</strong> (stripe.com) &mdash; View payment amounts, dates, and details</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Who Manages What?</h2>

<p>To keep things clear, here is who would be responsible for what:</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Task</th><th>Who handles it</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Update dates, fees, winners, contact info</td><td><strong>Chairs / Designated admin(s)</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>View registrations and payment status</td><td><strong>Chairs / Designated admin(s)</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Review proof-of-age documents</td><td><strong>Chairs / Designated admin(s)</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Change form fields or add new divisions</td><td><strong>Developer</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Fix technical issues or bugs</td><td><strong>Developer</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Major design or layout changes</td><td><strong>Developer</strong></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Designated admin(s) would be given edit access to the Google Sheets and the Stripe dashboard. The developer would support initial setup and major changes, but day-to-day updates (dates, fees, winners, etc.) can be handled by chairs without any technical knowledge.</p>

<div class="key-point">
  <strong>Ownership:</strong> All data and accounts &mdash; including the domain, Google Sheets, and Stripe &mdash; would be owned by MACOC, not by the developer. MACOC retains full control at all times.
</div>

<hr>

<h2>Cost Comparison</h2>

<h3>Current System (<a href="https://www.wix.com">Wix</a> + <a href="https://www.jotform.com">Jotform</a> Gold)</h3>

<table>
  <tr><th>Service</th><th>Monthly Cost</th><th>Annual Cost</th></tr>
  <tr class="cost-old"><td>Wix (Core Plan)</td><td>$29/month</td><td>$348/year</td></tr>
  <tr class="cost-old"><td>Jotform Gold</td><td>$99/month</td><td>$1,188/year</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>$128/month</strong></td><td><strong>$1,536/year</strong></td></tr>
</table>

<p>* In addition, <a href="https://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a> (integrated with Jotform for payment processing) charges transaction fees of approximately 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction on each registration payment.</p>

<h3>Proposed New System</h3>

<table>
  <tr><th>Service</th><th>Monthly Cost</th><th>Annual Cost</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
  <tr class="cost-new"><td>Website hosting (powered by Vercel)</td><td>$0</td><td>$0</td><td>Free</td></tr>
  <tr class="cost-new"><td>Google Sheets (data storage)</td><td>$0</td><td>$0</td><td>Free</td></tr>
  <tr class="cost-new"><td>Cloudinary (file storage)</td><td>$0</td><td>$0</td><td>Free (more than enough capacity)</td></tr>
  <tr class="cost-new"><td>Stripe (payments)</td><td>$0</td><td>$0</td><td>No monthly fee</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Domain (musicalartsoc.org)</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>~$15&ndash;20/year</td><td>Transfer from Wix to a domain registrar</td></tr>
  <tr class="highlight-row"><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>$0/month</strong></td><td><strong>~$15&ndash;20/year</strong></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<p>* Stripe charges a transaction fee of 2.9% + $0.30 per payment, similar to what PayPal currently charges through Jotform. This is only charged when a transaction occurs &mdash; there is no monthly fee.</p>

<p>* The domain (musicalartsoc.org) is currently managed through Wix. As part of this transition, the domain would be transferred to a separate domain registrar (such as Namecheap or Google Domains), which typically costs around $15&ndash;20 per year.</p>

<h3>Estimated Savings</h3>

<table>
  <tr><th></th><th>Annual Cost</th></tr>
  <tr class="cost-old"><td>Current System (Wix $348 + Jotform $1,188)</td><td>~$1,536/year</td></tr>
  <tr class="cost-new"><td>Proposed System (domain cost only)</td><td>~$15&ndash;20/year</td></tr>
  <tr class="cost-save"><td>Estimated Savings</td><td>~$1,500+/year</td></tr>
</table>

<hr>

<h2>How Would Management Change?</h2>

<h3>Current setup</h3>

<table>
  <tr><th>Area</th><th>How it works today</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Website content</td><td>Managed through the Wix editor</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Registration forms</td><td>Managed separately in Jotform</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Payment processing</td><td>Handled through PayPal (via Jotform)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Registration data</td><td>Stored in Jotform; requires login to view</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Proposed new setup</h3>

<table>
  <tr><th>Area</th><th>How it would work</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Website content</td><td>Edit in Google Sheets (like Excel)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Registration forms</td><td>Built into the website &mdash; no separate service</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Payment processing</td><td>Handled through Stripe</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Registration data</td><td>Automatically saved to Google Sheets &mdash; viewable anytime</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Side-by-Side Comparison</h3>

<table>
  <tr><th>Category</th><th>Current</th><th>Proposed</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Cost</td><td>$128/month ($1,536/year)</td><td><strong>$0/month (~$15&ndash;20/year)</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Edit content</td><td>Wix editor</td><td><strong>Google Sheets</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>View registrations</td><td>Log into Jotform</td><td><strong>View directly in Google Sheets</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Payment tracking</td><td>Check PayPal</td><td><strong>Stripe + Google Sheets</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Where is data?</td><td>Wix, Jotform, PayPal</td><td><strong>Google Sheets (one place)</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Sharing with others</td><td>Separate logins for each service</td><td><strong>Share one Google Sheets link</strong></td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="qa">
  <p class="qa-q">Q: I'm not familiar with Google Sheets. Is that okay?</p>
  <p class="qa-a">A: If you've ever used Excel, it's almost the same. Just click a cell and type. It saves automatically.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
  <p class="qa-q">Q: Is student data secure?</p>
  <p class="qa-a">A: Yes. Access to Google Sheets would be restricted to authorized MACOC staff only. Uploaded documents (such as proof of age) are stored securely in Cloudinary and are not publicly accessible. Payments are handled entirely by Stripe, and credit card information is never stored on the MACOC website.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
  <p class="qa-q">Q: What if someone accidentally changes something in Google Sheets?</p>
  <p class="qa-a">A: Google Sheets keeps automatic version history, so any accidental changes can be reviewed and rolled back easily.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
  <p class="qa-q">Q: Is the new website reliable?</p>
  <p class="qa-a">A: The website would be hosted on Vercel, a professional hosting platform used by millions of websites worldwide. If there is ever an issue, you can reach out to the developer for support.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
  <p class="qa-q">Q: What if we want to change the registration form?</p>
  <p class="qa-a">A: To change the form fields or questions, please ask the developer. Simple changes can usually be made quickly.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
  <p class="qa-q">Q: Where does the payment money go?</p>
  <p class="qa-a">A: It goes directly to the bank account linked to MACOC's Stripe account. You can check everything in the Stripe Dashboard.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
  <p class="qa-q">Q: Will all divisions be available (Strings, Voice, etc.)?</p>
  <p class="qa-a">A: We plan to add all divisions. The initial launch would start with Piano, and other divisions would follow.</p>
</div>

<div class="qa">
  <p class="qa-q">Q: What if the developer is no longer available?</p>
  <p class="qa-a">A: All data and accounts &mdash; including the domain, Google Sheets, and Stripe &mdash; would be owned by MACOC. Day-to-day content updates can be done by anyone with Google Sheets access. If a new developer is ever needed, they can pick up where things left off since all code and data belong to MACOC.</p>
</div>
